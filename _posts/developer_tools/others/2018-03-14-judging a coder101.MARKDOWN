I know this may sound like a snippet from a philosophy book (well I love philosophy) but it's really important to write about this issue so we can figure out together whether we've been in a Trump state or not (a state where you can judge whoever you want to serve your narcissistic needs).

#The battle with the judgmental coder

The judgmental coder is someone who judges everything, newborn coders, technologies and even experienced software engineers.

Have you ever met someone who made you feel like you're not good "enough" and you won't be. Maybe you've just started to learn how to code and you had a conversation with him where you had some shaky ideas and a lot of questions, so he assumed that you're not good enough to have a good career as a developer.

>Maybe you should learn another thing, design is easier I think 
    
Designers if you want to assassinate these kind of coders, just e-mail me, I'll  charge you 3 Bitcoins for these kind of assassinations.

>You can't work online, Indians get all the jobs with the low price they offer, unless you're good enough (which is not the case, remember?)

You heard that right?

>You're learning PHP ? like really? that thing is dying my friend.
 
>Nodejs? you're not serious, aren't you ? this isn't used in this country.

this is nonsense I know but believe me, beginners can be influenced by this kind of *assumptions* and we all heard stuff like these with different versions.Or we may have said that too, so we just have to stop assuming that 'some technologies will die soon or are useless', 'people aren't good unless they use Linux', etc.

#People from other fields

I bet you have some encouraging friends who try to push you to do what you want to do, but unfortunately we won't talk about these rare amazing people, we'll talk about your friends who doesn't understand your job or what you're trying to learn so they just hit you a huge amount of negativity that makes you feel bad coming from them, even though you anticipated the hit.

For my case I chose to study computer science in the university and I'm learning web development on my own, which is a really bad choice in my society here because I chose CS over medicine. So one of my friends who knows what I'm doing, asked sarcastically : "what will you do when you graduate? you'll work for a call center?"

#Dodging the judgmental coder/non coder hits?

## surround yourself with positive people

This is really important because anyone will face a lot of problems and having someone who support you is really a blessing.You don't want to find yourself with people who put you down when you're already down.

## find good communities like dev.to

I don't know if you're appreciating this community enough but you and I know that there's a lot of toxic people wherever you go which is not the case here in dev.to, stick with this community, share what you know and discuss what you have in my mind and you'll find a lot of interactions, support and good feedback with people who may being this field from decades

##do what you love and find harmony within yourself

Don't be harsh on yourself, you'll be better everyday so don't compare yourself with others and focus on your work and the things you want to do. It's okay to relax sometimes, it's okay if you didn't find a job. Don't put a lot of pressure on yourself; society and family will do that for you and you have to handle that as well, it's okay to have hard times, we all do.

So, if you need a judgmental coder, just contact me, I'll charge 1 Bitcoin for a normal one, 10 for someone who's living his life judging other coders.
