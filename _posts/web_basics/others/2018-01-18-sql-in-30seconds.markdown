SQL (generally pronounced "sequel") stands for Structured Query Language.

It's a language that gives you the ability to manage relational databases and it was created based on relational algebra and tuples calculus.
It makes you *Insert* (Create operation) data for your application.
Most importantly it makes you *Select* (Read operation) the data from the tables you created (search algorithms are not your business).
Additionally, You can *Update* (Update operation) and *delete* data (Delete Operation). 

CRUD = the four basic operations of persistent storage (Create, Read, Update,Delete).
